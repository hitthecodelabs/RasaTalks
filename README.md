# Rasa Chatbot Project Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up and developing a Rasa chatbot project using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

- Download and install VSCode from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Step 2: Install Python

- Ensure Python 3.10 or newer is installed on your system. Download it from https://www.python.org/.

## Step 3: Install Rasa

1. Open VSCode and start a new terminal session (Terminal > New Terminal).
2. Create a project directory for your Rasa project files.
3. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal using the `cd` command.
4. Create a Python virtual environment for your project:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ./rasa_venv
   ```
   On Windows, you might use `python` instead of `python3`.
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\rasa_venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source rasa_venv/bin/activate
     ```
6. Install Rasa within the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install rasa==3.6.16
   ```

## Step 4: Initialize Your Rasa Project

1. In the VSCode terminal, ensure you're in your project directory and your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the following command to create a new Rasa project:
   ```bash
   rasa init
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to create the initial project structure and train a simple bot.

## Step 5: Explore and Modify Your Project

- Open the project directory in VSCode (File > Open Folder) to start editing your files.
- Modify the generated files to develop your chatbot's training data and logic.

## Step 6: Train Your Rasa Model

- Retrain your model by running:
  ```bash
  rasa train
  ```

## Step 7: Test Your Bot in the Shell

- Test your chatbot by running:
  ```bash
  rasa shell
  ```

## Step 8: Develop Custom Actions (Optional)

- Edit `actions/actions.py` for custom actions.
- Start the action server with `rasa run actions`.

## Step 9: Use Version Control

- Initialize a Git repository and commit your changes:
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

## Step 10: Continuous Learning and Improvement

- Continue developing your bot by adding more training data, refining the domain, and adding custom actions as needed.

## Additional Tips

- Consider installing the Python extension for VSCode.
